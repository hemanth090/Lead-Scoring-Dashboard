## Architecture

### System Architecture
```
Frontend (React + TypeScript)
    ↓ HTTP/JSON
FastAPI Backend
    ↓
ML Pipeline (Scikit-learn)
    ↓
LLM Re-ranker (Rule-based)
    ↓
In-memory Storage
```

### Component Breakdown:

**Frontend:**
- React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Axios for API communication
- React Hook Form for form validation

**Backend:**
- FastAPI for high-performance API endpoints
- Pydantic for data validation and serialization
- CORS middleware for cross-origin requests
- In-memory storage for lead persistence

**ML Pipeline:**
- Scikit-learn GradientBoostingClassifier
- StandardScaler for numerical features
- OneHotEncoder for categorical features
- Joblib for model persistence

**Data Flow:**
1. User submits lead form → Frontend validation
2. API request to /score endpoint → Backend validation
3. Feature preprocessing → ML model prediction
4. Comment analysis → LLM re-ranker adjustment
5. Score storage → Response to frontend
6. Dashboard update → Local storage persistence

## Machine Learning Model

### Model Selection: Gradient Boosting Classifier

**Justification:**
- **High Performance:** Achieved 96.7% accuracy with 98.2% precision
- **Feature Importance:** Provides interpretable feature rankings
- **Robustness:** Handles mixed data types (numerical + categorical)
- **Speed:** Fast inference suitable for real-time scoring
- **Stability:** Less prone to overfitting compared to deep learning models

### Feature Engineering:
**Numerical Features (6):**
- credit_score, income, budget, previous_inquiries, time_on_market, response_time_minutes

**Categorical Features (4):**
- age_group, family_background, property_type, location

### Model Performance Metrics:
- **Accuracy:** 96.7%
- **Precision:** 98.2% (high confidence in positive predictions)
- **Recall:** 84.6% (captures most high-intent leads)
- **F1-Score:** 90.9% (balanced precision-recall)
- **ROC-AUC:** 99.7% (excellent discrimination ability)

### Feature Importance Analysis:
1. **response_time_minutes (35.1%):** Fastest responders show highest intent
2. **income (25.2%):** Higher income correlates with purchase readiness
3. **time_on_market (16.7%):** Newer listings generate more interest
4. **credit_score (14.8%):** Better credit indicates financial readiness
5. **previous_inquiries (7.7%):** Fewer inquiries suggest focused interest

## LLM-Inspired Re-ranker

### Rule-Based Keyword Analysis

**High-Intent Keywords (+5 to +20 points):**
- "urgent", "ready to purchase", "cash buyer" → +10 to +20
- "pre-approved loan", "financing ready" → +15
- "very interested", "perfect match" → +10
- "immediately", "asap", "today" → +8 to +12

**Low-Intent Keywords (-5 to -20 points):**
- "just browsing", "not interested" → -15 to -20
- "maybe next year", "not ready" → -15
- "need to think", "not sure yet" → -10
- "too expensive", "out of budget" → -12 to -15

**Neutral Keywords (0 to +3 points):**
- "information", "details", "interested in" → +2 to +3
- "location", "price", "features" → 0 to +2

### Re-ranking Logic:
1. Parse comments for keyword matches (case-insensitive)
2. Sum adjustment scores for all matched keywords
3. Apply adjustment to initial ML score
4. Clamp final score to 0-100 range

**Example:**
- Initial ML Score: 65
- Comment: "Very interested and ready to purchase immediately"
- Adjustments: +10 (very interested) + 20 (ready to purchase) + 10 (immediately) = +40
- Final Score: min(100, 65 + 40) = 100
